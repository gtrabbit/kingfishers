<h1>Gerard Manley Hopkins</h1> 
	<p><em>1844-1889</em></p>

<p>By most accounts, Hopkins would be considered a minor late-Victorian poet. I'm not much of a biographer, and I don't care too much for biographys, but I don't think he ever even published a full book of poetry. Though well regarded by many for the power of his writing, it seems his style is too dense, obscure and idiosyncratic to be a good subject for study in school. This, combined with the heavily religious nature of his writing, has led to his seldom being studied in literature classes today. </p>
<p>I myself had never really encountered Hopkins until I was searching through sonnets for a class I was teaching and found his "As Kingfishers Catch Fire." Though I knew almost nothing about Hopkins and couldn't make much sense of the poem at first, I was struck by its intensity and decided to include it along with a packet I was printing out for my students. It went in with a couple other poems as optional if-we-have-time pieces, and I didn't think much else about it until one of my students asked me about. As I struggled myself to find meaning in the poem, I slowly started to notice a rich interplay of symbolism and structure that eluded my first reads. </p>
<p> I have many times since then returned to this poem and attempted to get a handle on it, but I am afraid that I am not able to give anything close to an authoritative reading. Nonetheless, this is a good excuse to write an essay on what I've found so far. Here is the full poem, followed by my commentary:</p>




<h2>As Kingfishers Catch Fire</h2>
	<p>As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame</p>
	<p>As tumbled over rim in roundy wells</p>
	<p>Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's</p>
	<p>Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;</p>
	<p>Each mortal thing does one thing and the same;</p>
	<p>Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;</p>
	<p>Selves-- goes itself, myself it speaks and spells,</p>
	<p>Crying What I do is me: for that I came.</p><br>
	<p>I say more: the just man justices:</p>
	<p>keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces</p>
	<p>Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is--</p>
	<p>Christ-- for Christ plays in ten thousand places,</p>
	<p>Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his</p>
	<p>To the Father through the features of men's faces</p>
